This is a repository for all of my configurations files for my Arch Linux instal.

Currently, only one of my machines is running Arch, but to make sure I do it correctly 
from the begining I will be using a branch for each machine. So this branch is named
after the machine these configuration files are for.

For most of the configuration files the different branches will be identical. However,
it is possible that for certain hardware issues (such as sound and bluetooth on this
computer) a different configuration will be necessary. 

Cheers
